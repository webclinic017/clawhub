- [x] ~~Move `src/routes/upload.test.tsx` out of `src/routes/` (fix TanStack Start build warning)~~
- [x] ~~Add `state` nonce to browser auth (`clawdhub auth login`) and validate on loopback receiver~~
- [ ] Well-known v1: `/.well-known/clawdhub.json` => `{ apiBase, authBase?, minCliVersion? }` (keep backward compat)
- [ ] Centralize registry resolution (single `getRegistry()`), cache discovery in global config
- [ ] Split `packages/clawdhub/src/cli.ts` into modules (<500 LOC per file)
- [ ] Proxy `https://clawdhub.com/api/*` to discovered `apiBase` (single-base-URL UX)
- [ ] Full gate: `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run coverage`, `bun run build`, CI green
